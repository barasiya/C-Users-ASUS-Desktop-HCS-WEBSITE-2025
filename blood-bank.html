Transfusion medicine (or transfusiology) is the branch of medicine that is concerned with transfusion of blood and its components. Ever since the discovery of blood types early in the last century, the branch has evolved at a breakneck pace. Simple blood transfusion is a medical therapy which can be life saving hence this branch is a vital part of the health care system. Transfusion is more than a single discrete event- it is a process.

The transfusion chain begins with donor considerations (whether the donation is safe for the donor to make and safe for the recipient to receive). Once blood is collected, the safety of the blood product is a focus of activity (infectious disease testing, compatibility testing, necessary modifications such as irradiation or leucocyte reduction). The end point of transfusion process involves recipient considerations (proper identification of the unit and the patient, appropriateness of blood as the best treatment modality, administration of the unit and post transfusion evaluation of the patient).
